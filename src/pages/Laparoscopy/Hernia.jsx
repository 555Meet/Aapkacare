          lide3:"• Strangulation:",
          answer3:"One of the most severe complications of a hernia is strangulation, which occurs when the blood supply to the trapped organ is. This can lead to tissue damage and necrosis (tissue death), a medical emergency.",

                        <p className="text-gray-700">A hernia is when an internal organ or tissue pushes through a weak spot or tear in the muscles or connective tissues that typically hold it in place. Hernias can develop in any part of the body, but most commonly, they occur in the abdominal area. Hernias can appear as painful bulges that gradually grow in size.</p>
