                        <p className="text-gray-700">Gallbladder stones, also known as gallstones or cholelithiasis, are solid particles that form in the gallbladder, a small organ located just beneath the liver. The gallbladder's primary function is to store bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver, and release it into the small intestine to help digest the fats needed. A gallstone can vary in size from tiny grains of sand to larger, golf ball-sized stones. They primarily comprise cholesterol or bilirubin, a pigment produced when red blood cells break down.</p>

                                    The doctor will begin by taking a detailed medical history and conducting a physical examination. They will ask about your symptoms, including abdominal pain, digestive issues, or jaundice.

                                <li class="mb-2">
                                    <strong>Do not skip meals- </strong>
                                    Try your best to stick with the usual meal times each day. Skipping meals can cause excess bile secretion and deposition.

                                    Being overweight is a risk factor for gallstone development. So, if you are trying to lose weight, take things slow. Don't push your body to its limits in order to lose weight as rapid weight loss can cause the liver to secrete extra cholesterol, which can further increase the risk of gallstones.  
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Eat high-fiber foods- </strong>
                                    Foods that are rich in fiber ensure that the levels of bad cholesterol in the body are minimal. Furthermore, fiber keeps the digestive system moving and helps to flush out the bile from the body. Therefore, it is crucial that you add more fiber to your diet

                                    <strong>Exercise regularly- </strong>
                                    It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do an extensive workout, being physically active is enough. The less you move, the slower the digestion process will be. As a result, the bile won't flush out correctly. Invest some time in exercising and leave the sedentary lifestyle behind.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Take prescribed medications- </strong>
                                    People who are at high risk of developing gallstones due to heredity or other factors can take medicines to lower the risk of gallstone formation.
