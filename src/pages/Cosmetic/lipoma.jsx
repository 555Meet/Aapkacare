Although they can develop in any area of the body, lipomas usually affect the shoulders, forearms, arms, and thighs. Lipoma typically manifests as little, floppy lumps. Pressing it could make it feel doughy. Lipomas usually don't hurt, but they can especially when they rub against surrounding nerves or have blood arteries running through them.</p>
