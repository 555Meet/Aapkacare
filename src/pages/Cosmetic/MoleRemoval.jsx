Moles occur in a variety of colours, including brown, black. Moles can be round, oval, or even smaller. Moles are caused by the body's overactive melanocytes, which create excessive melanin.

                                    In some cases, especially if hormonal imbalances cause Gynecomastia, medication may be prescribed. The most commonly used medication for Gynecomastia is tamoxifen, which can help reduce breast tissue growth. 
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Surgery:</strong>
                                    Surgery is often the most effective treatment for moderate to severe Gynecomastia. There are two main surgical procedures.

                                    <strong>Liposuction:</strong>Liposuction is used to remove excess fat from the breast area. It is particularly effective for cases where Gynecomastia is primarily due to excess fat.

                                    <strong>Surgical excision:</strong>Surgical excision is necessary for cases involving excess breast tissue and epithelial growth. This procedure involves making an incision and removing the excess tissue. Depending on the extent of the surgery, scarring may be minimal to more noticeable.
