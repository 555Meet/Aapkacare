This procedure is also known as Renal Transplantation. The kidney transplant is a major and complex procedure that takes about 3 to 5 hours to complete and is performed under general anaesthesia. The procedure has a high success rate.</p>

The primary cause of kidney replacement is end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in which the kidneys have lost most or all of their normal function. Several common causes of ESRD can lead to the need for kidney replacement:
