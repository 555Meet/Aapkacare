The doctor may check for tenderness in the scrotum while putting slight pressure around the scrotum and lower abdominal region. If the fluid is present, the scrotum will allow light transmission. The doctor may also ask you to cough to check whether you experience pain in the scrotum region. There are a few diagnostic tests the doctor may recommend to find the underlying cause: Blood test - Urine culture</p>
