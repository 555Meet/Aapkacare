                        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Knee arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure performed to diagnose and treat knee joint injury and other similar issues. During arthroscopy surgery, the surgeon makes 2-3 tiny incisions over the knee joint to insert an arthroscope and surgical instruments. </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700">The arthroscope has a camera and light attached to it and helps the surgeon visualize internal structures to avoid soft tissue damage. Since the surgery involves minimal incisions, it usually promises a shorter and easier recovery period compared to open surgery. </p>
