                        <p className="text-gray-700">Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a procedure for fixing a rotator cuff tear, from shaving bone spurs or repairing torn tendons and muscles in the shoulder. If the patient's injury extends beyond the rotator cuff, then the surgeon can perform modified rotator cuff surgery with bicep repair to correct the injury. </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700">The rotator cuff comprises a group of muscles and tendons surrounding the shoulder joint. It is responsible for supporting the shoulder joint and keeping the head of the arm within the joint socket. Rotator cuff surgeries are performed for rotator cuff injuries. Rotator cuff damage is very common in people who have jobs that require repeated overhead motions or in athletes due to sudden jerking motions. </p>

                        <p class="text-md mb-4">Before the surgery, the orthopaedic surgeon will perform a thorough diagnosis. Diagnosis before knee arthroscopy entails physical examination, along with imaging tests like X-rays, shoulder CT scans, MRI, etc. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-md mb-4">On the day of the surgery, the surgeon may also perform a blood panel, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, etc., to assess your vital signs and make sure you can safely undergo the surgery. Following this, the anesthesia will be administered and you will be moved to the operation theater for the surgery. Knee arthroscopy can be performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-md mb-4">The surgeon will make a few tiny incisions, called portals, over the knee joint to fill the joint with a sterile solution to improve visibility. Then an arthroscope is inserted to visualize the internal structures. Finally, with the help of the arthroscope, the surgeon will insert the surgical instruments and perform the surgery. After the surgery, the incisions will be closed and bandaged.  
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-md mb-4">The surgery usually lasts less than an hour and then the patient is moved to a recovery room for post-surgery observation to ensure there are no postoperative complications.
