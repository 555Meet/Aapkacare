      Understanding Hip Replacement Surgery
    </h2>
    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4">
      When hip problems become severe and conservative treatments no longer provide relief, hip replacement surgery becomes a viable option. This surgical procedure involves replacing a damaged or diseased hip joint with an artificial implant, alleviating pain, and restoring mobility.

      The Hip Replacement Process
    </h2>
    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4">
      The process of hip replacement surgery typically involves the following steps:
    </p>
    <ol className="list-decimal ml-5 mb-4 text-xl space-y-2">
      <li>
        <span className="font-bold">Pre-surgery Assessment:</span> Your doctor will conduct a thorough evaluation of your hip condition to determine the extent of damage and your overall health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-bold">Surgical Procedure:</span> During the surgery, the damaged joint is replaced with a prosthetic implant designed to mimic the natural hip joint.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mt-2">
      <span className="font-bold">Recovery and Rehabilitation:</span> After surgery, a period of rehabilitation and physical therapy is essential to regain strength and mobility.

      Understanding Hip Replacement Surgery
    </h2>
    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Hip replacement surgery is usually performed to replace the damaged hip joint with artificial implants to restore joint mobility and function. An orthopedic surgeon usually recommends this surgery to patients with severe hip joint arthritis or necrosis, who've become bedridden due to pain and joint instability.
    </p>
    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Hip replacement surgery is also known as hip arthroplasty. The aim of the procedure is to allow you to resume daily activities and exercise without any pain.
