                        <p className="text-gray-700">Knee replacement, or knee arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure that is commonly recommended to restore the mobility and normal function of the knee joint. There are various reasons for which the orthopedic surgeon can advise you to get knee replacement surgery, such as osteoarthritis, knee arthritis, trauma, or knee injury. It is usually only advised to people who have become bedridden due to severe knee joint pain and/or instability. </p>
